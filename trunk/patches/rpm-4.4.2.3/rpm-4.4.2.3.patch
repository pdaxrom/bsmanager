-Notes on the Free Translation Project
-*************************************
-
-   Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project
-is a way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
-together, so that will gradually become able to speak many languages.
-A few packages already provide translations for their messages.
-
-   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may
-assume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,
-itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_
-need to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using
-this package with messages translated.
-
-   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
-explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
-available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
-work at translations should contact the appropriate team.
-
-   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be
-related to internationalization, you should tell about the version of
-`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the
-`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.
-
-Quick configuration advice
-==========================
-
-   If you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you
-should configure it using
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-
-to force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this
-package, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the
-operating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only
-the `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as
-many features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic
-charset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.
-It is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top
-of a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will
-very likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea
-to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.
-
-   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or
-you have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the
-included `libintl'.
-
-INSTALL Matters
-===============
-
-   Some packages are "localizable" when properly installed; the
-programs they contain can be made to speak your own native language.
-Most such packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own
-ways to internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.
-
-   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
-messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already
-provides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the GNU `gettext' own
-library will be used.  This library is wholly contained within this
-package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior installation of
-the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.  Installers may use
-special options at configuration time for changing the default
-behaviour.  The commands:
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-     ./configure --disable-nls
-
-will respectively bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the
-internationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,
-_totally_ disable translation of messages.
-
-   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run
-configure without an option for your new package, `configure' will
-probably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and
-will decide to use this.  This might be not what is desirable.  You
-should use the more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e.
-if the file `intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this
-package is more recent, you should use
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-
-to prevent auto-detection.
-
-   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function
-and therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an
-emulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the
-extensions of the GNU `gettext' library.
-
-   Internationalized packages have usually many `po/LL.po' files, where
-LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
-translations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the
-`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
-together with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'
-may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
-`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
-codes, stating which languages are allowed.
-
-Using This Package
-==================
-
-   As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
-only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
-`LL_CC' combination.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code,
-and `CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's
-suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell
-prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),
-`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').
-This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for
-all.
-
-   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
-But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
-example, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
-country code serves to distinguish the dialects.
-
-   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
-English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
-understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
-This is done through a different environment variable, called
-`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
-for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
-set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
-system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
-read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
-available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.
-
-   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
-environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
-to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
-to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
-(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.
-
-Translating Teams
-=================
-
-   For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
-people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
-able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
-Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of
-teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
-`http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/', in the "National teams"
-area.
-
-   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you
-should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
-The subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has
-`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
-message to `sv-request@li.org', having this message body:
-
-     subscribe
-
-   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
-_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,
-rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and
-you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to
-get started, please write to `translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to reach the
-coordinator for all translator teams.
-
-   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
-the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skill are praised more than
-programming skill, here.
-
-Available Packages
-==================
-
-   Languages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following
-matrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of September
-2001.  The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages
-PO files have been submitted to translation coordination, with a
-translation percentage of at least 50%.

-
-   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to

-Using `gettext' in new packages
-===============================
-
-   If you are writing a freely available program and want to
-internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your
-package.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public
-License which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means
-in particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared
-library, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static
-library or use modified versions of `libintl'.
-
-   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
-to use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
-Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
-developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
-applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
-`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to make the `.pot' files available to
-the translation teams.

-dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
-
-dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
-dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
-dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
-dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
-dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
-dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
-dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
-dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
-dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
-dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
-dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
-dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
-dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
-dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
-dnl    the value `$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
-dnl
-dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
-dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
-dnl    and used.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
-dnl    Catalog format: none
-dnl    Catalog extension: none
-dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
-dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
-dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
-dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
-dnl maintainers.

-# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
-# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
-# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
-#
-# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
-# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
-# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
-# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
-# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
-# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
-# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
-#
-# $ac_aux_dir/missing
-#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
-# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
-#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
-#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
-#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
-#
-# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
-# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
-# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
-# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
-#
-# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
-# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
-#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
-# and then we would define $MISSING as
-#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
-# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
-# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
-# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
-# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
-#
-# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
-# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a

-\`configure' configures this package to adapt to many kinds of systems.
-
-Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
-
-To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
-VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
-
-Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
-
-Configuration:
-  -h, --help              display this help and exit
-      --help=short        display options specific to this package
-      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
-  -V, --version           display version information and exit
-  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
-      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
-  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
-  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
-      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
-
-Installation directories:
-  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
-			  [$ac_default_prefix]
-  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
-			  [PREFIX]
-
-By default, \`make install' will install all the files in

-.SH DESCRIPTION
-The popt library exists essentially for parsing command-line 
-options. It is found superior in many ways when compared to 
-parsing the argv array by hand or using the getopt functions 
-.B getopt()
-and 
-.B getopt_long()
-[see 
-.BR getopt "(3)]."  
-Some specific advantages of popt are: it does not utilize global 
-.RI "variables, thus enabling multiple passes in parsing " argv
-.RI "; it can parse an arbitrary array of " argv "-style elements, "
-allowing parsing of command-line-strings from any source; 
-it provides a standard method of option aliasing (to be 
-discussed at length below.); it can exec external option filters; and,
-finally, it can automatically generate help and usage messages for
-the application.
-.sp
-Like
-.BR getopt_long() ,
-the popt library supports short and long style options.  Recall 
-that a 
-.B short option
-consists of a - character followed by a single alphanumeric character.
-A 
-.BR "long option" ,
-common in GNU utilities, consists of two - characters followed by a
-string made up of letters, numbers and hyphens.  Long options are
-optionally allowed to begin with a single -, primarily to allow command-line
-compatibility between popt applications and X toolkit applications.
-Either type of option may be followed by an argument.  A space separates a 
-short option from its arguments; either a space or an = separates a long 
-option from an argument. 
-.sp
-The popt library is highly portable and should work on any POSIX 
-platform.  The latest version is distributed with rpm and is always available
-from: ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist.
-.sp
-It may be redistributed under the X consortium license, see the file COPYING
-in the popt source distribution for details.
-.SH "BASIC POPT USAGE"
-.SS "1. THE OPTION TABLE"
-Applications provide popt with information on their command-line 
-options by means of an "option table," i.e., an array of 
-.B struct poptOption 
-structures:
-.sp
-#include <popt.h>
-.sp
-.nf
-struct poptOption {
-    const char * longName; /* may be NULL */
-    char shortName;        /* may be '\\0' */
-    int argInfo;
-    void * arg;            /* depends on argInfo */
-    int val;               /* 0 means don't return, just update flag */
-    char * descrip;        /* description for autohelp -- may be NULL */
-    char * argDescrip;     /* argument description for autohelp */
-};
-.fi
-.sp
-Each member of the table defines a single option that may be 
-passed to the program.  Long and short options are considered 
-a single option that may occur in two different forms.  The 
-first two members, 
-.IR longName " and " shortName ", define the names of the option;"
-the first is a long name, while the latter is a single character.
-.sp
-The 
-.IR argInfo " member tells popt what type of argument is expected" 
-after the argument.  If no option is expected,
-.B POPT_ARG_NONE
-should be used.
-The rest of the valid values are shown in the following table:
-.sp
-.TS
-lfB lfB lfB
-lfB lfR lfR.
-Value	Description	arg Type
-POPT_ARG_NONE	No argument expected	int
-POPT_ARG_STRING	No type checking to be performed	char *
-POPT_ARG_INT	An integer argument is expected	int
-POPT_ARG_LONG	A long integer is expected	long
-POPT_ARG_VAL	Integer value taken from \f(CWval\fR	int
-POPT_ARG_FLOAT	An float argument is expected	float
-POPT_ARG_DOUBLE	A double argument is expected	double
-.TE
-.sp
-For numeric values, if the \fIargInfo\fR value is bitwise or'd with one of
-\fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_OR\fR, \fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_AND\fR, or \fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_XOR\fR,
-the value is saved by performing an OR, AND, or XOR.
-If the \fIargInfo\fR value is bitwise or'd with \fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_NOT\fR,
-the value will be negated before saving. For the common operations of
-setting and/or clearing bits, \fBPOPT_BIT_SET\fR and \fBPOPT_BIT_CLR\fR
-have the appropriate flags set to perform bit operations.
-.sp
-If the \fIargInfo\fR value is bitwise or'd with \fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_ONEDASH\fR,
-the long argument may be given with a single - instead of two. For example,
-if \fB--longopt\fR is an option with \fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_ONEDASH\fR, is
-specified, \fB-longopt\fR is accepted as well.
-.sp
-.RI "The next element, " arg ", allows popt to automatically update "
-.RI "program variables when the option is used. If " arg " is " 
-.BR NULL ", it is ignored and popt takes no special action. " 
-Otherwise it should point to a variable of the type indicated in the 
-right-most column of the table above.
-.sp
-.RI "If the option takes no argument (" argInfo " is " 
-.BR POPT_ARG_NONE "), the variable pointed to by " 
-.IR arg " is set to 1 when the option is used.  (Incidentally, it "
-will perhaps not escape the attention of hunt-and-peck typists that 
-.RB "the value of " POPT_ARG_NONE " is 0.)  If the option does take "
-an argument, the variable that 
-.IR arg " points to is updated to reflect the value of the argument." 
-.RB "Any string is acceptable for " POPT_ARG_STRING " arguments, but "
-.BR POPT_ARG_INT ", " POPT_ARG_LONG ", " POPT_ARG_FLOAT ", and "
-.BR POPT_ARG_DOUBLE " are converted to the appropriate type, and an "
-error returned if the conversion fails.
-.sp
-\fBPOPT_ARG_VAL\fR causes \fIarg\fP to be set to the (integer) value of
-\fIval\fP when the argument is found.  This is most often useful for
-mutually-exclusive arguments in cases where it is not an error for
-multiple arguments to occur and where you want the last argument
-specified to win; for example, "rm -i -f".  \fBPOPT_ARG_VAL\fP causes
-the parsing function not to return a value, since the value of \fIval\fP
-has already been used.
-.sp
-If the \fIargInfo\fR value is bitwise or'd with \fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_OPTIONAL\fR,
-the argument to the long option may be omitted. If the long option
-is used without an argument, a default value of zero or NULL will be saved
-(if the arg pointer is present), otherwise behavior will be identical to
-a long option with argument.
-.sp
-.RI "The next option, " val ", is the value popt's parsing function 
-should return when the option is encountered.  If it is 0, the parsing
-function does not return a value, instead parsing the next 
-command-line argument.
-.sp
-.RI "The last two options, " descrip " and " argDescrip " are only required
-if automatic help messages are desired (automatic usage messages can
-.RI "be generated without them). " descrip " is a text description of the
-.RI "argument and " argdescrip " is a short summary of the type of arguments
-.RI "the option expects, or NULL if the option doesn't require any 
-arguments.
-.sp
-.RB "If popt should automatically provide " --usage " and " --help " (" -? ")
-.RB "options, one line in the table should be the macro " POPT_AUTOHELP ".
-.RB "This macro includes another option table (via " POPT_ARG_INCLUDE_TABLE;
-see below) in the main one which provides the table entries for these
-.RB "arguments. When " --usage " or " --help " are passed to programs which
-use popt's automatical help, popt displays the appropriate message on 
-stderr as soon as it finds the option, and exits the program with a
-return code of 0. If you want to use popt's automatic help generation in
-a different way, you need to explicitly add the option entries to your programs 
-.RB "option table instead of using " POPT_AUTOHELP ".
-.sp
-If the \fIargInfo\fR value is bitwise or'd with \fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_DOC_HIDDEN\fR,
-the argument will not be shown in help output.
-.sp
-If the \fIargInfo\fR value is bitwise or'd with \fBPOPT_ARGFLAG_SHOW_DEFAULT\fR,
-the inital value of the arg will be shown in help output.
-.sp
-The final structure in the table should have all the pointer values set
-.RB "to " NULL " and all the arithmetic values set to 0, marking the "
-.RB "end of the table. The macro " POPT_TABLEEND " is provided to do that.
-.sp
-There are two types of option table entries which do not specify command
-line options. When either of these types of entries are used, the
-\fIlongName\fR element must be \fBNULL\fR and the \fBshortName\fR element
-must be \fB'\\0'\fR.
-.sp
-The first of these special entry types allows the application to nest
-another option table in the current one; such nesting may extend quite
-deeply (the actual depth is limited by the program's stack). Including
-other option tables allows a library to provide a standard set of
-command-line options to every program which uses it (this is often done
-in graphical programming toolkits, for example). To do this, set
-the \fIargInfo\fR field to \fBPOPT_ARG_INCLUDE_TABLE\fR and the
-\fRarg\fR field to point to the table which is being included. If
-automatic help generation is being used, the \fIdescrip\fR field should
-contain a overall description of the option table being included.
-.sp
-The other special option table entry type tells popt to call a function (a
-callback) when any option in that table is found. This is especially usefull
-when included option tables are being used, as the program which provides
-the top-level option table doesn't need to be aware of the other options
-which are provided by the included table. When a callback is set for
-a table, the parsing function never returns information on an option in
-the table. Instead, options information must be retained via the callback
-or by having popt set a variable through the option's \fIarg\fR field.
-Option callbacks should match the following prototype:
-.sp
-.nf
-.BI "void poptCallbackType(poptContext con, 
-.BI "                      const struct poptOption * opt, 
-.BI "                      const char * arg, void * data);
-.fi
-.sp
-The first parameter is the context which is being parsed (see the next
-section for information on contexts), \fIopt\fR points to the option
-which triggered this callback, and \fIarg\fR is the option's argument.
-If the option does not take an argument, \fIarg\fR is \fBNULL\fR.  The
-final parameter, \fIdata\fR is taken from the \fIdescrip\fR field
-of the option table entry which defined the callback. As \fIdescrip\fR
-is a pointer, this allows callback functions to be passed an arbitrary
-set of data (though a typecast will have to be used).
-.sp
-The option table entry which defines a callback has an \fIargInfo\fR of
-\fBPOPT_ARG_CALLBACK\fR, an \fIarg\fR which points to the callback
-function, and a \fIdescrip\fR field which specifies an arbitrary pointer
-to be passed to the callback.
-.SS "2. CREATING A CONTEXT"
-popt can interleave the parsing of multiple command-line sets. It allows
-this by keeping all the state information for a particular set of
-command-line arguments in a 
-.BR poptContext " data structure, an opaque type that should not be "
-modified outside the popt library.
-.sp
-.RB "New popt contexts are created by " poptGetContext() ":"
-.sp
-.nf
-.BI "poptContext poptGetContext(const char * " name ", int "argc ",
-.BI "                           const char ** "argv ",
-.BI "                           const struct poptOption * "options ",
-.BI "                           int "flags ");"
-.fi
-.sp
-The first parameter, 
-.IR name ", is used only for alias handling (discussed later). It "
-should be the name of the application whose options are being parsed,
-.RB "or should be " NULL " if no option aliasing is desired. The next "
-two arguments specify the command-line arguments to parse. These are 
-.RB "generally passed to " poptGetContext() " exactly as they were "
-.RB "passed to the program's " main() " function. The " 
-.IR options " parameter points to the table of command-line options, "
-which was described in the previous section. The final parameter, 
-.IR flags ,
-can take one of three values:
-.br
-.TS
-lfB lfB
-lfB lfR.
-Value	Description
-POPT_CONTEXT_NO_EXEC	Ignore exec expansions
-POPT_CONTEXT_KEEP_FIRST	Do not ignore argv[0]
-POPT_CONTEXT_POSIXMEHARDER	Options cannot follow arguments
-.TE
-.sp
-.RB "A " poptContext " keeps track of which options have already been "
-parsed and which remain, among other things. If a program wishes to 
-restart option processing of a set of arguments, it can reset the 
-.BR poptContext " by passing the context as the sole argument to "
-.BR poptResetContext() .
-.sp
-When argument processing is complete, the process should free the 
-.BR poptContext " as it contains dynamically allocated components. The "
-.BR poptFreeContext() " function takes a " 
-.BR poptContext " as its sole argument and frees the resources the "
-context is using.
-.sp
-.RB "Here are the prototypes of both " poptResetContext() " and "
-.BR poptFreeContext() :
-.sp
-.nf
-.B #include <popt.h>
-.BI "void poptFreeContext(poptContext " con ");"
-.BI "void poptResetContext(poptContext " con ");"
-.fi
-.sp
-.SS "3. PARSING THE COMMAND LINE"
-.RB "After an application has created a " poptContext ", it may begin "
-.RB "parsing arguments. " poptGetNextOpt() " performs the actual "
-argument parsing.
-.sp
-.nf
-.B #include <popt.h>
-.BI "int poptGetNextOpt(poptContext " con ");"
-.fi
-.sp
-Taking the context as its sole argument, this function parses the next
-command-line argument found. After finding the next argument in the
-option table, the function fills in the object pointed to by the option 
-.RI "table entry's " arg 
-.RB "pointer if it is not " NULL ". If the val entry for the option is "
-non-0, the function then returns that value. Otherwise, 
-.BR poptGetNextOpt() " continues on to the next argument."
-.sp
-.BR poptGetNextOpt() " returns -1 when the final argument has been "
-parsed, and other negative values when errors occur. This makes it a 
-good idea to 
-.RI "keep the " val " elements in the options table greater than 0."
-.sp
-.RI "If all of the command-line options are handled through " arg 
-pointers, command-line parsing is reduced to the following line of code:
-.sp
-.nf
-rc = poptGetNextOpt(poptcon);
-.fi
-.sp
-Many applications require more complex command-line parsing than this,
-however, and use the following structure:
-.sp
-.nf
-while ((rc = poptGetNextOpt(poptcon)) > 0) {
-     switch (rc) {
-          /* specific arguments are handled here */
-     }
-}
-.fi
-.sp
-When returned options are handled, the application needs to know the
-value of any arguments that were specified after the option. There are two
-ways to discover them. One is to ask popt to fill in a variable with the 
-.RI "value of the option through the option table's " arg " elements. The "
-.RB "other is to use " poptGetOptArg() ":"
-.sp
-.nf
-.B #include <popt.h>
-.BI "const char * poptGetOptArg(poptContext " con ");"
-.fi
-.sp
-This function returns the argument given for the final option returned by
-.BR poptGetNextOpt() ", or it returns " NULL " if no argument was specified."
-.sp
-.SS "4. LEFTOVER ARGUMENTS"
-Many applications take an arbitrary number of command-line arguments,
-such as a list of file names. When popt encounters an argument that does
-not begin with a -, it assumes it is such an argument and adds it to a list
-of leftover arguments. Three functions allow applications to access such
-arguments:
-.nf
-.HP
-.BI "const char * poptGetArg(poptContext " con ");"
-.fi
-This function returns the next leftover argument and marks it as
-processed.
-.PP
-.nf
-.HP
-.BI "const char * poptPeekArg(poptContext " con ");"
-.fi
-The next leftover argument is returned but not marked as processed.
-This allows an application to look ahead into the argument list,
-without modifying the list.
-.PP
-.nf
-.HP
-.BI "const char ** poptGetArgs(poptContext " con ");"
-.fi
-All the leftover arguments are returned in a manner identical to 
-.IR argv ".  The final element in the returned array points to "
-.BR NULL ", indicating the end of the arguments.
-.sp
-.SS "5. AUTOMATIC HELP MESSAGES"
-The \fBpopt\fR library can automatically generate help messages which
-describe the options a program accepts. There are two types of help
-messages which can be generated. Usage messages are a short messages
-which lists valid options, but does not describe them. Help messages
-describe each option on one (or more) lines, resulting in a longer, but
-more useful, message. Whenever automatic help messages are used, the
-\fBdescrip\fR and \fBargDescrip\fR fields \fBstruct poptOption\fR members
-should be filled in for each option.
-.sp
-The \fBPOPT_AUTOHELP\fR macro makes it easy to add \fB--usage\fR and
-\fB--help\fR messages to your program, and is described in part 1
-of this man page. If more control is needed over your help messages,
-the following two functions are available:
-.sp
-.nf
-.B #include <popt.h>
-.BI "void poptPrintHelp(poptContext " con ", FILE * " f ", int " flags ");
-.BI "void poptPrintUsage(poptContext " con ", FILE * " f ", int " flags ");
-.fi
-.sp
-\fBpoptPrintHelp()\fR displays the standard help message to the stdio file
-descriptor f, while \fBpoptPrintUsage()\fR displays the shorter usage
-message. Both functions currently ignore the \fBflags\fR argument; it is
-there to allow future changes.
-.sp
-.SH "ERROR HANDLING"
-All of the popt functions that can return errors return integers. 
-When an error occurs, a negative error code is returned. The 
-following table summarizes the error codes that occur:
-.sp
-.nf
-.B "     Error                      Description"
-.BR "POPT_ERROR_NOARG       " "Argument missing for an option."
-.BR "POPT_ERROR_BADOPT      " "Option's argument couldn't be parsed."
-.BR "POPT_ERROR_OPTSTOODEEP " "Option aliasing nested too deeply."
-.BR "POPT_ERROR_BADQUOTE    " "Quotations do not match."
-.BR "POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER   " "Option couldn't be converted to number."
-.BR "POPT_ERROR_OVERFLOW    " "A given number was too big or small."
-.fi
-.sp
-Here is a more detailed discussion of each error:
-.sp
-.TP
-.B POPT_ERROR_NOARG
-An option that requires an argument was specified on the command
-line, but no argument was given. This can be returned only by
-.BR poptGetNextOpt() .
-.sp
-.TP
-.B POPT_ERROR_BADOPT
-.RI "An option was specified in " argv " but is not in the option 
-.RB "table. This error can be returned only from " poptGetNextOpt() .
-.sp
-.TP
-.B POPT_ERROR_OPTSTOODEEP
-A set of option aliases is nested too deeply. Currently, popt 
-follows options only 10 levels to prevent infinite recursion. Only 
-.BR poptGetNextOpt() " can return this error."
-.sp
-.TP
-.B POPT_ERROR_BADQUOTE
-A parsed string has a quotation mismatch (such as a single quotation
-.RB "mark). " poptParseArgvString() ", " poptReadConfigFile() ", or "
-.BR poptReadDefaultConfig() " can return this error."
-.sp
-.TP
-.B POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER
-A conversion from a string to a number (int or long) failed due
-to the string containing nonnumeric characters. This occurs when
-.BR poptGetNextOpt() " is processing an argument of type " 
-.BR POPT_ARG_INT ", " POPT_ARG_LONG ", "
-.RB POPT_ARG_FLOAT ", or " POPT_ARG_DOUBLE "."  
-.sp
-.TP
-.B POPT_ERROR_OVERFLOW
-A string-to-number conversion failed because the number was too
-.RB "large or too small. Like " POPT_ERROR_BADNUMBER ", this error 
-.RB "can occur only when " poptGetNextOpt() " is processing an "
-.RB "argument of type " POPT_ARG_INT ", " POPT_ARG_LONG ", "
-.RB POPT_ARG_FLOAT ", or " POPT_ARG_DOUBLE "."  
-.sp
-.TP
-.B POPT_ERROR_ERRNO
-.RI "A system call returned with an error, and " errno " still 
-contains the error from the system call. Both 
-.BR poptReadConfigFile() " and " poptReadDefaultConfig() " can "
-return this error.
-.sp
-.PP
-Two functions are available to make it easy for applications to provide
-good error messages.
-.HP
-.nf
-.BI "const char *const poptStrerror(const int " error ");"
-.fi
-This function takes a popt error code and returns a string describing
-.RB "the error, just as with the standard " strerror() " function."
-.PP
-.HP
-.nf
-.BI "const char * poptBadOption(poptContext " con ", int " flags ");"
-.fi
-.RB "If an error occurred during " poptGetNextOpt() ", this function "
-.RI "returns the option that caused the error. If the " flags " argument"
-.RB "is set to " POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS ", the outermost option is "
-.RI "returned. Otherwise, " flags " should be 0, and the option that is "
-returned may have been specified through an alias.
-.PP
-These two functions make popt error handling trivial for most 
-applications. When an error is detected from most of the functions, 
-an error message is printed along with the error string from 
-.BR poptStrerror() ". When an error occurs during argument parsing, "
-code similiar to the following displays a useful error message:
-.sp
-.nf
-fprintf(stderr, "%s: %s\\n",
-        poptBadOption(optCon, POPT_BADOPTION_NOALIAS),
-        poptStrerror(rc));
-.fi
-.sp
-.SH "OPTION ALIASING"
-.RB "One of the primary benefits of using popt over " getopt() " is the "
-ability to use option aliasing. This lets the user specify options that 
-popt expands into other options when they are specified. If the standard 
-.RB "grep program made use of popt, users could add a " --text " option "
-.RB "that expanded to " "-i -n -E -2" " to let them more easily find "
-information in text files.
-.sp
-.SS "1. SPECIFYING ALIASES"
-.RI "Aliases are normally specified in two places: " /etc/popt 
-.RB "and the " .popt " file in the user's home directory (found through "
-.RB "the " HOME " environment variable). Both files have the same format, "
-an arbitrary number of lines formatted like this:
-.sp
-.IB appname " alias " newoption "" " expansion"
-.sp
-.RI "The " appname " is the name of the application, which must be the "
-.RI "same as the " name " parameter passed to "
-.BR poptGetContext() ". This allows each file to specify aliases for "
-.RB "multiple programs. The " alias " keyword specifies that an alias is "
-being defined; currently popt configuration files support only aliases, but
-other abilities may be added in the future. The next option is the option
-that should be aliased, and it may be either a short or a long option. The
-rest of the line specifies the expansion for the alias. It is parsed 
-similarly to a shell command, which allows \\, ", and ' to be used for 
-quoting. If a backslash is the final character on a line, the next line 
-in the file is assumed to be a logical continuation of the line containing 
-the backslash, just as in shell.
-.sp
-.RB "The following entry would add a " --text " option to the grep command, "
-as suggested at the beginning of this section.
-.sp
-.B "grep alias --text -i -n -E -2"
-.SS "2. ENABLING ALIASES"
-.RB "An application must enable alias expansion for a " poptContext 
-.RB "before calling " poptGetNextArg() " for the first time. There are "
-three functions that define aliases for a context:
-.HP
-.nf
-.BI "int poptReadDefaultConfig(poptContext " con ", int " flags ");"
-.fi
-.RI "This function reads aliases from " /etc/popt " and the "
-.BR .popt " file in the user's home directory. Currently, "
-.IR flags " should be "
-.BR NULL ", as it is provided only for future expansion."
-.PP
-.HP
-.nf
-.BI "int poptReadConfigFile(poptContext " con ", char * " fn ");"
-.fi
-.RI "The file specified by " fn " is opened and parsed as a popt "
-configuration file. This allows programs to use program-specific 
-configuration files.
-.PP
-.HP
-.nf
-.BI "int poptAddAlias(poptContext " con ", struct poptAlias " alias ",
-.BI "                 int " flags ");"
-.fi
-Occasionally, processes want to specify aliases without having to
-read them from a configuration file. This function adds a new alias
-.RI "to a context. The " flags " argument should be 0, as it is "
-currently reserved for future expansion. The new alias is specified 
-.RB "as a " "struct poptAlias" ", which is defined as:"
-.sp
-.nf
-struct poptAlias {
-     const char * longName; /* may be NULL */
-     char shortName; /* may be '\\0' */
-     int argc;
-     const char ** argv; /* must be free()able */
-};
-.fi
-.sp
-.RI "The first two elements, " longName " and " shortName ", specify "
-.RI "the option that is aliased. The final two, " argc " and " argv ","
-define the expansion to use when the aliases option is encountered.
-.PP
-.SH "PARSING ARGUMENT STRINGS"
-Although popt is usually used for parsing arguments already divided into
-.RI "an " argv "-style array, some programs need to parse strings that "
-are formatted identically to command lines. To facilitate this, popt 
-provides a function that parses a string into an array of strings, 
-using rules similiar to normal shell parsing.
-.sp
-.nf
-.B "#include <popt.h>"
-.BI "int poptParseArgvString(char * " s ", int * " argcPtr ",
-.BI "                        char *** " argvPtr ");"
-.BI "int poptDupArgv(int " argc ", const char ** " argv ", int * " argcPtr ",
-.BI "                        const char *** " argvPtr ");"
-.fi
-.sp
-.RI "The string s is parsed into an " argv "-style array. The integer "
-.RI "pointed to by the " argcPtr " parameter contains the number of elements "
-.RI "parsed, and the final " argvPtr " parameter contains the address of the"
-newly created array.
-.RB "The routine " poptDupArgv() " can be used to make a copy of an existing "
-argument array.
-.sp
-.RI "The " argvPtr 
-.RB "created by " poptParseArgvString() " or " poptDupArgv() " is suitable to pass directly "
-.RB "to " poptGetContext() .
-Both routines return a single dynamically allocated contiguous
-.RB "block of storage and should be " free() "ed when the application is"
-finished with the storage.
-.SH "HANDLING EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
-Some applications implement the equivalent of option aliasing but need
-.RB "to do so through special logic. The " poptStuffArgs() " function "
-allows an application to insert new arguments into the current 
-.BR poptContext .
-.sp
-.nf
-.B "#include <popt.h>"
-.BI "int poptStuffArgs(poptContext "con ", const char ** " argv ");"
-.fi
-.sp
-.RI "The passed " argv 
-.RB "must have a " NULL " pointer as its final element. When "
-.BR poptGetNextOpt() " is next called, the "
-"stuffed" arguments are the first to be parsed. popt returns to the 
-normal arguments once all the stuffed arguments have been exhausted.
-.SH "EXAMPLE"
-The following example is a simplified version of the program "robin" 
-which appears in Chapter 15 of the text cited below.  Robin has 
-been stripped of everything but its argument-parsing logic, slightly 
-reworked, and renamed "parse." It may prove useful in illustrating 
-at least some of the features of the extremely rich popt library.

-% Idea is to have all the characters normally included in Type 1 fonts
-% available for typesetting. This is effectively the characters in Adobe
-% Standard Encoding + ISO Latin 1 + extra characters from Lucida.
-% 
-% Character code assignments were made as follows:
-% 
-% (1) the Windows ANSI characters are almost all in their Windows ANSI
-% positions, because some Windows users cannot easily reencode the
-% fonts, and it makes no difference on other systems. The only Windows
-% ANSI characters not available are those that make no sense for
-% typesetting -- rubout (127 decimal), nobreakspace (160), softhyphen
-% (173). quotesingle and grave are moved just because it's such an
-% irritation not having them in TeX positions.
-% 
-% (2) Remaining characters are assigned arbitrarily to the lower part
-% of the range, avoiding 0, 10 and 13 in case we meet dumb software.
-% 
-% (3) Y&Y Lucida Bright includes some extra text characters; in the
-% hopes that other PostScript fonts, perhaps created for public
-% consumption, will include them, they are included starting at 0x12.
-% 
-% (4) Remaining positions left undefined are for use in (hopefully)
-% upward-compatible revisions, if someday more characters are generally
-% available.
-% 
-% (5) hyphen appears twice for compatibility with both ASCII and Windows.

-This is the popt command line option parsing library. While it is similiar
-to getopt(3), it contains a number of enhancements, including:
-
-	1) popt is fully reentrant
-	2) popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays while 
-	   getopt(2) makes this quite difficult
-	3) popt allows users to alias command line arguments
-	4) popt provides convience functions for parsing strings
-	   into argv[] style arrays
-
-popt is used by rpm, the Red Hat install program, and many other Red Hat
-utilities, all of which provide excellent examples of how to use popt. 
-Complete documentation on popt is available in popt.ps (included in this
-tarball), which is excerpted with permission from the book "Linux
-Application Development" by Michael K. Johnson and Erik Troan (availble
-from Addison Wesley in May, 1998).
-
-Comments on popt should be addressed to ewt@redhat.com.
